# **Rainfall Prediction Project** ⚡️

This project focuses on building a lightning-fast classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day. It involves applying various machine learning algorithms to a rainfall dataset obtained from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## **Dataset 📊**

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The data will be cleaned and preprocessed before applying the classification algorithms.

## **Algorithms Used 🧠**

The following classification algorithms will be implemented in this project:

Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics 📏
The performance of each classifier will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score

## **Getting Started 🚀**
