# **Rainfall Prediction Project** ‚ö°Ô∏è

This project focuses on building a lightning-fast classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day. It involves applying various machine learning algorithms to a rainfall dataset obtained from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## **Dataset üìä**

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The data will be cleaned and preprocessed before applying the classification algorithms.

## **Algorithms Used üß†**

The following classification algorithms will be implemented in this project:

1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)


## **Evaluation Metrics üìè**
The performance of each classifier will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1.	Accuracy Score
2.	Jaccard Index
3.	F1-Score
4.	LogLoss
5.	Mean Absolute Error
6.	Mean Squared Error
7.	R2-Score

## **Getting Started üöÄ**
To run the project and reproduce the results, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/zanda95/Rainfall-Prediction-Project.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and place it in the data directory.
4. Open the notebook rainfall_prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data and apply the classification algorithms.
6. Evaluate the performance of each classifier using the provided evaluation metrics.
7. Explore the results and conclusions presented in the notebook.
